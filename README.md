 Rethereum is a new blockchain project that aims to revive the original vision of Ethereum as a global, decentralized platform for money and new kinds of applications.
 Rethereum is based on a modified version of the Ethereum Go client, which is a fork of the official 1.11.6 release. This was the final release to support Proof-of-Work.

 Rethereum is not just another Ethereum clone.
